One of these buildings was the Fort Canning Bunker or Battle Box, where the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese was made by the British. Many war relics from Singapore's colourful history have survived on the hill and are still visible today.Although the hill has since lost its imposing stature, its distinctive charm still remains.

It is located just to the West of the Singapore-Johore road (Bukit Timah Expressway) on Woodlands Road, just to the south of the crossroads with Turf Club Avenue and Kranji Road. There is a short approach road from the main road. The Cemetery is known locally as Kranji Memorial and one must be sure of the address before boarding a taxi as most taxi drivers do not know the Cemetery.

Set in acres of lush, tropical grounds, the Singapore Polo Club is a world apart from Singapore's bustling pace yet located just minutes from the heart of the city's hectic business and commercial centre. The main focus of the Club is of course polo and more generally, equestrian sports, but other sports activities and facilities are also well represented. Members can either keep their own polo ponies at the club stables, or alternatively lease ponies from the Club's own string. Beginners, or those wishing to hone their skills may sign up for polo lessons with the Club's resident pros. For those interested primarily in horse riding, you can participate in any of the Club's varied Riding Section programmes and activities including basic riding, competitive dressage as well as show jumping at various levels, either in one to one or group lessons with our qualified riding instructors.",3.5,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Located in the rejuvenated Fort Canning Arts Centre, a heritage building set atop Singapore's historic and cultural landmark, Fort Canning Park, Singapore Pinacothèque takes centre stage with its distinctive expertise in international fine art, and offers a unique voice on history and culture in the region's visual arts landscape. 'Pinacothèque' translates as 'box of paintings' and refers to a place where paintings (or any image) are kept in which private collector pieces were displayed for public appreciation. We aim to stimulate your sense of curiosity and wonder through uniquely curated exhibitions, and by combining storytelling with state-of-the-art technology to create an experience that is immersive, interactive, engaging and fun. The museum's three main galleries feature a permanent collection of masterpieces, twice-yearly rotating blockbuster exhibitions, and a collection of artefacts that traces the legacy of Southeast Asia and Singapore. Delivering a fresh perspective on art, the exhibitions are curated with founder Marc Restellini's signature 'Transversality' credo that presents a dialogue between different works of art, connecting both artists and audiences alike through emotional and thematic links that cut across boundaries of genre, culture and era. The Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris Art Academy, La Boutique Pinacothèque museum shop and a unique variety of international retail and dining concepts also converge at Fort Canning Arts Centre to create a vibrant community of art appreciation, education and lifestyle for everyone.",3.0,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The famous counter shines like new amidst decor that marries architecture and contemporary plantation-inspired motifs. Long Bar was located at Cad’s Alley in the early 1900s. At a time when improved rail and road systems brought rubber and palm oil plantation owners over to Singapore from Malaya every weekend, it was known as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’. The earthy decor of the two-storey Long Bar is inspired by Malayan life in the 1920s. The deep, rich colours and lush greenery transport patrons to the edge of a tropical plantation. In keeping with the relaxed atmosphere, guests are invited to brush peanut shells off the table and bar counter to the floor.

It is a sport where women and men compete equally, and, which is not dominated by the younger nor the faster. Like a game of chess, being able to think quickly and decisively, is what makes you a unique individual in paintball. Teamwork and determination, not merely strength, speed or agility, are keys to success in the sport. The memory of your colleague sitting beside you right now shooting you in paintball brings such an adrenaline rush that you know you want to win him or her in the next death match! Red Dynasty Paintball Park (ORTO, Yishun) Formerly known as Bottle Tree Park, Red Dynasty Paintball Park (ORTO, Yishun) is newly renovated and situated right in the heart of ORTO Leisure Park where there are activities for the whole family. Easily accessible and conveniently located, Red Dynasty Paintball Park (ORTO, Yishun) features inflatable walls and bunkers which allow close contact battle paintball games which is different from the rest of the other paintball outlets managed by Red Dynasty Paintball Park. Red Dynasty Paintball Park (ORTO, Yishun) is also the first recreational paintball arena in Singapore which can accommodate night games up to 11 pm.

A hidden gem nestled in a historical district warms the hearts and soles of Singaporeans, going beyond their excellent and satisfying foot reflexology services to provide a place for a community to come together while creating employment opportunities for senior workers. Channelling the spirit of an open piazza or hip bistro, Feet Haven aims to be a crossroads for meaningful interaction, exchange of views and a meeting place bringing together multiple generations of Singaporeans. A boutique foot reflexology spa offering foot reflexology and body massages, Feet Haven employs a unique business model in caring for the community. From supporting various community causes – such as displaying paintings of local budding artists and hosting homegrown theatre performances – to only hiring committed, experienced people with a passion for the job, the founders also make it a point to provide employment to senior masseurs and therapists. Overall, this means first-rate massage services in a vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere. Explains co-owner Dennis Toh, “The benefits of foot reflexology to the immune system, energy levels and blood circulation are well-known, especially to older customers. And therein lies the challenge, of how to make this ancient treatment appeal to a new generation of customers as a treat, much like dropping in somewhere to get your nails done or eat a macaron or watch a romantic flick. I wanted to make Feet Haven a place for people to swing by, stay for a little while, catch up with friends while treating themselves to a small, everyday luxury.” Signature standout treatments include the 60-minute Shiok Feet Indulgence; 60-minute Shiok Basic Body and 45-minute Shiok Basic Blend of a shoulder- and neck massage coupled with foot reflexology. Located in the hip enclaves of Katong and Serangoon Gardens that are seeing strings of young, independent restaurants, cafés and retail businesses, the boutique spa aims to banish the dull, old-fashioned reputation of foot reflexology centres that typically attract an older clientele. With its fun daily status updates outside the shop; fresh, Polaroid-sprinkled interiors giving off a youthful vibe; acclaim among bloggers; and popularity with new parents, Feet Haven sees a stream of young people who, after trying out the services, very often return with their parents in tow. Accolades have naturally followed: Feet Haven was awarded the Best Foot Massage by Harpers Bazaar Spa Awards 2013 and named Best Value Simply Her Foot Spa by Simply Her in the same year.
