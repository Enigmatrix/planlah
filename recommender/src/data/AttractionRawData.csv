1855,Feet Haven East Coast,"#01-01, 136 East Coast Road, Singapore 428821 Singapore","Founded in April 2011, Feet Haven Reflexology is a boutique Foot Reflex spa offering foot reflexology and body massages to its customers. A hidden gem nestled in a historical district warms the hearts and soles of Singaporeans, going beyond their excellent and satisfying foot reflexology services to provide a place for a community to come together while creating employment opportunities for senior workers. Channelling the spirit of an open piazza or hip bistro, Feet Haven aims to be a crossroads for meaningful interaction, exchange of views and a meeting place bringing together multiple generations of Singaporeans. A boutique foot reflexology spa offering foot reflexology and body massages, Feet Haven employs a unique business model in caring for the community. From supporting various community causes – such as displaying paintings of local budding artists and hosting homegrown theatre performances – to only hiring committed, experienced people with a passion for the job, the founders also make it a point to provide employment to senior masseurs and therapists. Overall, this means first-rate massage services in a vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere. Explains co-owner Dennis Toh, “The benefits of foot reflexology to the immune system, energy levels and blood circulation are well-known, especially to older customers. And therein lies the challenge, of how to make this ancient treatment appeal to a new generation of customers as a treat, much like dropping in somewhere to get your nails done or eat a macaron or watch a romantic flick. I wanted to make Feet Haven a place for people to swing by, stay for a little while, catch up with friends while treating themselves to a small, everyday luxury.” Signature standout treatments include the 60-minute Shiok Feet Indulgence; 60-minute Shiok Basic Body and 45-minute Shiok Basic Blend of a shoulder- and neck massage coupled with foot reflexology. Located in the hip enclaves of Katong and Serangoon Gardens that are seeing strings of young, independent restaurants, cafés and retail businesses, the boutique spa aims to banish the dull, old-fashioned reputation of foot reflexology centres that typically attract an older clientele. With its fun daily status updates outside the shop; fresh, Polaroid-sprinkled interiors giving off a youthful vibe; acclaim among bloggers; and popularity with new parents, Feet Haven sees a stream of young people who, after trying out the services, very often return with their parents in tow. Accolades have naturally followed: Feet Haven was awarded the Best Foot Massage by Harpers Bazaar Spa Awards 2013 and named Best Value Simply Her Foot Spa by Simply Her in the same year. It has also been featured in popular publications including 8 Days, Cleo, Mother &amp; Baby, Young Parents and Eastie Brekkie. Feet Haven cares about Singaporeans and Singapore beyond alleviating sores, aches, stiffness and knots. The business strives to genuinely make a difference and contribute to the sustainability of a place with thoughtful practices.",Spas,3.0,12
