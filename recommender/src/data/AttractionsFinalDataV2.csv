A hidden gem nestled in a historical district warms the hearts and soles of Singaporeans, going beyond their excellent and satisfying foot reflexology services to provide a place for a community to come together while creating employment opportunities for senior workers. Channelling the spirit of an open piazza or hip bistro, Feet Haven aims to be a crossroads for meaningful interaction, exchange of views and a meeting place bringing together multiple generations of Singaporeans. A boutique foot reflexology spa offering foot reflexology and body massages, Feet Haven employs a unique business model in caring for the community. From supporting various community causes ûû such as displaying paintings of local budding artists and hosting homegrown theatre performances ûû to only hiring committed, experienced people with a passion for the job, the founders also make it a point to provide employment to senior masseurs and therapists. Overall, this means first-rate massage services in a vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere. Explains co-owner Dennis Toh, ûûThe benefits of foot reflexology to the immune system, energy levels and blood circulation are well-known, especially to older customers. And therein lies the challenge, of how to make this ancient treatment appeal to a new generation of customers as a treat, much like dropping in somewhere to get your nails done or eat a macaron or watch a romantic flick. I wanted to make Feet Haven a place for people to swing by, stay for a little while, catch up with friends while treating themselves to a small, everyday luxury.ûû Signature standout treatments include the 60-minute Shiok Feet Indulgence; 60-minute Shiok Basic Body and 45-minute Shiok Basic Blend of a shoulder- and neck massage coupled with foot reflexology. Located in the hip enclaves of Katong and Serangoon Gardens that are seeing strings of young, independent restaurants, cafÃ©s and retail businesses, the boutique spa aims to banish the dull, old-fashioned reputation of foot reflexology centres that typically attract an older clientele. With its fun daily status updates outside the shop; fresh, Polaroid-sprinkled interiors giving off a youthful vibe; acclaim among bloggers; and popularity with new parents, Feet Haven sees a stream of young",3.0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kJW9KFwCam0/VZfXERvh53I/AAAAAAAAKs4/oN2yle47y8g/s1600/Feet%2BHaven_Jodulu%2B%25287%2529.JPG

During World War II, the hill was instrumental in Singapore's war efforts with numerous military buildings located there. One of these buildings was the Fort Canning Bunker or Battle Box, where the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese was made by the British. Many war relics from Singapore's colourful history have survived on the hill and are still visible today.Although the hill has since lost its imposing stature, its distinctive charm still remains.
