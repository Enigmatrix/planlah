<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.3 Messages

You can send messages in our application through DMs (direct messages) or group chats. 

DMs are treated by our application as a special group that only has 2 members maximum so that one can plan outings with just their friend alone. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.3.1 Send messages in a group

Sending a message in our group is intuitive. Simply click on the `Type here` text field and type your message with your phone's virtual keyboard.

![](https://i.imgur.com/chhJlfm.png)

Click on the `right arrow` button to send your message. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/pBNiwLt.png)

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>


### 2.4 Friends

planlah revolves around friends and groups so the next important step is learning how to add your friends on the application. 

First navigate to the friends tab by clicking on the `Friends` tab in the bottom navigation bar.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EhNj7KW.png)

In the `Friends` page, you can see all your current friends, search for friends as well as see all your incoming friend requests. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.1 Sending a Friend Request

Click on the `magnifying glass` icon to enter the `Search Friends` page. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/IUlH4WR.png)

Click on the `Search` button and enter your friend's username or real name. This is not case sensitive. 

For example, I am adding my friend Akash so I would type in `Akash` as seen from the image below. 

Now you can either press the `Enter` button on your keyboard or click the `magnifying glass` icon again. 

This will show all search results given your query but will not display any accounts matching the query that are already friends with you. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/P6VbzEL.png)

Now click on the tile for your friend. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/LWPBm5Z.png)

Click on the `Add friend icon` to send a friend request to your friend. It will now show up as an incoming friend request on your friend's planlah app. 

When your friend accepts your friend request, he will then show up on your friends list page. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>


### 2.4.2 See all Friend Requests

Click on the `Friend Request` button at the top-right most of the `Friends` page to view all your incoming friend requests.

![](https://i.imgur.com/AAHSWVn.png)

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>


### 2.4.3 Rejecting a Friend Request

Click on the `X` button to reject a friend request.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.4 Accept a Friend Request

Click on the `Tick` button to accept a friend request.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.5. View a Friend's profile

There are many ways to view a friend's profile page. Most of the time, if you see a widget with a `Circular` profile picture, clicking on the picture will direct you to the friend's profile picture.

From the friend's page, you can directly click on a tile to view their profile page. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.6 Create a DM with a Friend

From your friend's profile page, 

![](https://i.imgur.com/tIE8Fpx.png)

click on the `Envelope` icon to start a DM with your friend. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/fuvJfTg.png)

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5 Outings

Outings are the bedrock of planlah.

### 2.5.1 Create Outing from a Group

You can create an outing for a group or with just a friend (in a DM).
The procedure is the same for both.

First navigate either to the DM or the Group Chat page and click on the `clipboard` icon. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/cAJ0iPD.jpg)

If the group is not currently in an outing, this will direct you to the `Create Outing` page. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/9UyfWP1.png)

Enter your outing's name, description. 

You must specify when your outing starts and when it ends. Click on the third button titled `When's the fun?` and you will be directed to a `Scheduling` widget.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yZVNXJ7.png)

This gives you a calendar view. Input the date when your outing starts and the date when it ends. If you want it to start and end on the same day, just click the same day twice. 

The picture below shows an example of an outing from 25 July to 27 July.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JEY8aoK.png)

When you are satisfied with your outing's schedule, click the `Save` button. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZY97OOs.png)

The next step is to set the voting deadline. 

All outing steps in an outing are confirmed by votes before a specified deadline. 

Click on the fourth button `Vote Deadline` and you will be be shown the `Deadline` dialog widget. This `Vote Deadline` must be before the start of the outing (in the case of a outing on the same day as the current day, the `Vote Deadline` must be before the end of the day).

![](https://i.imgur.com/A13D6WZ.png)

Simply input when your group members must confirm their votes by.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gAAU0kp.png)

Above is what a sample completed `Create Outing` form might look like.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5.2 Add a Outing Step

When your outing is created, you will be directed to an empty outing page. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/WiGVIJI.png)

The first step is to add a place/restaurant that you would like the group to vote on.

Click on the `plus` floating button and you will be directed to the `create outing step` page. 

The first time you arrive at this page, you will be asked to give permission for our application to access your device's location. Please provide the permission as we require your coordinates to provide recommendations that are close to your current position. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/DsYdCaW.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/YPWTPpr.png)

In this page, input a description of what you'd like to do or eat. This is shown to your group so type an informative description.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5.2.1 Search for Places

The second button has 2 sub buttons. If you already know where you want to go, simply click on the button `Choose where to go!`. 

You will be directed to a `Search Place` widget. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/FX6gTGi.png)

Type the name of the location you want to go to in the `Search` text field. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ybL13qp.png)

The results will be displayed. Click on the `Left Arrow Key` or `Right Arrow Key` if your intended location does not show up, or refine your text query even more. 

When you have found your desired location, click on the tile to choose it. 

The page will now update with the place's profile. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/NuHWTB8.jpg)

You can click on the `X` button to the top right if you want to change the place.

You can also click on the place's card itself to go to the `Place Profile Page` where you can see any reviews for the place or leave a review for the place yourself. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5.2.2

Alternatively, if you don't have any good places in mind, click on the `Unsure` button. 

Choose whether you want to eat (the hamburger icon in green) or play (the headphones icon).

![](https://i.imgur.com/LMnPggo.png)

Based on your indicated preferences for either food or activity, our application will recommend you the places that most suit your preferences within a 2km radius of your current locations. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/8YRtx5S.jpg)

Above is an example output if you had decided on `Attractions`.
If you had clicked on `Food`, you would get restaurants with food that match your taste buds instead. 

Finally, you must specify when this `outing step` will start and end. 

First specify the date by clicking on the `date` button. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/fmCQT56.png)

This pulls up a calendar view where you can choose the date.

Then, specify when to start and end by clicking on `When?`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GDWieKu.png)

This pulls up a widget where you can specify the start and end of the outing step. In the picture above, I have decided to start at 10.55am and end at 15.45pm, plenty of time to eat ice cream.

![](https://i.imgur.com/5udTVPp.jpg)

The picture above shows sample, valid input for creation of an outing step. 

Finally, click on the `Let's go` button to confirm your choice. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/8ZBPgD7.jpg)

The `Outing` page will now display your suggestion.

Other members of the group can also suggest their own places to go or food to eat. 

Here is a sample screen when another user has suggested a place. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/0SJZFEs.jpg)

As seen above, another user has suggested going for steak instead.
However, the two outing steps conflict in time, and this is visually shown by the color of the cards being orange. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5.3 Vote for an Outing Step

Resolving conflicts are done through votes. 

As part of group dynamics, we want users to vote for outing steps that they want to participate in. An outing step is only added to the final outing itinerary when it has a majority-or-even number of `yes` votes, compared to `no` votes.

Voting is as simple as pressing `yes` or `no`

![](https://i.imgur.com/V9oUOOg.jpg)

The card turns green if a majority votes yes and a linear gradient is shown for cards with contesting votes. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.5.4 Lock-in Outing by voting deadline
Voting will be counted as long as it's before the `Vote Deadline` of the outing. After that, our algorithm will filter out the outing steps with insufficient votes. Then, it will resolve directly conflicting outing steps on a First-Come-First-Serve basis till there are no conflicts left.

Referring back to the example above, after the voting deadline is over, the Daily Scoop is chosen as the final outing since it had 3 votes for vs Angus Beef with 2 votes for. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/G4Hs0r4.jpg)

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>


### 2.5.5 View all past Outings from a Group

To reminisce about past outings with the group, or to add a post about an outing you've just completed, we have the feature to view all past outings from a group.

Navigate to the group chat page

![](https://i.imgur.com/lQSWJZY.png)

and click on `See past outings`.

You will be directed to the `See past outings` page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X1rmVDR.png)


Click on an outing card to view the Itinerary for that outing. 

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>


### 2.6 Posts

As a social media application, planlah also supports creating and viewing posts. 

### 2.6.1 View Posts by Friends

Viewing a post made by a friend is really easy.

First, navigate to your friend's profile page. 

Make sure that you have selected `Posts` in the tab bar. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2ck7UJi.jpg)

You can then scroll through your friend's social posts. 

### 2.6.2 Create a post

Since planlah revolves around outings, so do our posts. 

To create a post, you must create a post in the context of an outing step. This means that you can only create a post for an outing step that is currently ongoing or completed.

When these conditions are satisfied, our UI is updated to include a `Post` button. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/7ChhftI.jpg)

Click on the `Post` button to be redirected to the `Create Post` dialog.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vzIXJU3.png)

Input a title for your post and upload a picture (through your camera or by uploading an image in your gallery).

![](https://i.imgur.com/Gqb9hD8.png)

Confirm the details by pressing the `Okay` button. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/TXLxUyd.jpg)

The post will now show up on your profile page.

### 2.6.3 View Outing from Post

Since posts are tagged to an outing, you can view the entire outing from the post itself.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BBerFvR.jpg)

Every post card has a `View Outing` button.

Click on it to be directed to the `View Outing` page. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/7hdZDcr.png)

This page is a view-only screen for the outing. 

### 2.7 Reviews

Since planlah aims to be the premier social media application for Singaporeans planning outings, reviews from Singaporeans on places/restaurants are paramount to helping other Singaporeans make informed decisions regarding what to eat and where to go. 

Reviews are tied to a user's profile hence acting as a layer of enforcement to avoid trolls and unlawful review bombing of a restaurant. 

### 2.7.1 View all reviews for a place

From the create outing step, you can click on the place's card to be directed to the reviews page for the place. 

Here you can view all the reviews made by other users and a quick summary of the number of reviews and average review. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/MoKPUEa.jpg)

The picture above is for a place with no reviews.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qfwLzKa.jpg)

The picture above shows sample reviews by other users.


### 2.7.2 Create a review for a place

Click on the `Write a review` button to be directed to the `Create Review` form.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6i8sthW.png)

Write your review in the text box and rate the place 1-5 stars on the rating bar indicator.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HJgsRYh.png)

After you have completed your review, submit it by pressing the `tick` icon button.

Your review will now be displayed on the place's profile page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UHblmpj.jpg)

### 2.7.3 View all reviews by a user
